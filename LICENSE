Usage together with ASP.Net/Kestrel/Internet Information Services (IIS) or
in conjunction with any/all Microsoft web stacks requires a commercial
license. The same constraint applies for the API signatures and general
design â€” a commercial license is needed if used in conjunction with any/all
Microsoft web stacks.

Beyond this usage constraint, Apache 2.0 applies:
